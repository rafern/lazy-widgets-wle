# lazy-widgets-wle example project

Basic example project for how to use lazy-widgets in Wonderland Engine.

## Installation

This project is also used for continuous integration, so some extra steps are
needed before opening the project:
1. Delete `package-lock.json`
2. Replace `file:..` with the current lazy-widgets-wle version (`^0.3.0`) in `package.json`

After this is done, the project can be opened in the Wonderland Engine editor
as usual.
